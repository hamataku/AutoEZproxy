## Description

AutoEZproxy is an extension that automatically redirects you to the EZproxy login page when you visit a website that is not accessible from off-campus. This extension is particularly useful for students who need to access library or journal resources from off-campus locations.

For example, if you are a student of the University of Tokyo and access to

    springer.com

you will be redirected to

    https://utokyo.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://www.springer.com

You can also set up your own EZproxy server in the option page.
